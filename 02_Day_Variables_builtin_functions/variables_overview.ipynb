    "# Python Variables Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction to Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are fundamental building blocks in programming. They act as containers for storing data values, allowing you to manipulate and reference that data throughout your code. In Python, variables are dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare their type—Python infers it based on the value assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Typing:** Python automatically infers the variable type based on its value\n",
    "- **Flexible:** Can store different types of data\n",
    "- **Readable:** Should use clear, descriptive names\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What are Variable Types?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data types define the nature of data that a computer can process, store, and manipulate. They determine:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How the data is stored in memory\n",
    "- What operations can be performed on it\n",
    "- The methods and functions available for that data\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports several built-in data types, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strings**: Text data (e.g., `\"Hello, World!\"`)\n",
    "- **Integers**: Whole numbers (e.g., `42`)\n",
    "- **Floats**: Decimal numbers (e.g., `3.14`)\n",
    "- **Booleans**: True or False values (e.g., `True`)\n",
    "- **Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and more**: For storing collections of data\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What We'll Cover:\n",
    "1. **Variable Declarations**: How to create and assign values to variables.\n",
    "2. **Data Types**: Exploring the different types of data in Python.\n",
    "3. **Operations**: Performing arithmetic, string manipulation, and comparisons.\n",
    "4. **Built-in Functions**: Using Python's built-in tools to work with variables and data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Each section includes practical examples and demonstrations to help you understand how these concepts work in real Python code.*\n"

    "   - The user is prompted to enter their first name, last name, country, city, age, current year, and marital status.\n",
    "   - The data is stored in variables with specific data types (`str`, `int`, `bool`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Processes the Data**:\n",
    "   - Combines the first name and last name to create a full name.\n",
    "   - Converts user input to the correct data types (e.g., `age` and `year` are converted to integers).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Displays the Data**:\n",
    "   - The data entered by the user is printed to the console in a structured format."
